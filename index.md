# Computer Graphics 2021.1

On this page my work will be presented throughout the Computer Graphics course at UFJF, using the three.js library.

The basic projects that support the course can be obtained at [this link](https://rodrigoluis.github.io/CG/)

## Class 01 - Introduction to three.js

### Exercise 01 

Create three cubes of different sizes in different positions on the base plane


* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex01.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex01.js)

### Exercise 02

Create a cube, a sphere and a cylinder on the base plane

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex02.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex02.js)

### Exercise 03

Create nine cubes on the base plane using a loop

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex03.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex03.js)

## Class 02 - Geometric Transformation

### Exercise 01

Add a segment to the developed virtual arm [in this code](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/src/geometricTransformation2.js) and a slider that controls it

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula02_ex1.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula02_ex01.js)

### Exercise 02

Enable the rotation of the base of each segment on the three axes

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula02_ex02.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula02_ex02.js)


## Class 03 - Projections and Virtual Cameras

### Exercise 01

Develop an environment that allows the navigation through manipulation of the camera position

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula03.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula03.js)

## Class 04 - Animations

### Exercise 01

Add two yellow cylinders rotating in opposite directions to the [animation.js file](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/src/animation.js).

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula04_ex01.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula04_ex01.js)

### Exercise 02

Create a scene that contains a sphere of radius 1 and a 25x25 plane. Create sliders to determine the sphere's position in the plane and the "move" button that when clicked starts the sphere displacement animation

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula04_ex02.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula04_ex02.js)


## Class 06 - 3D Object Representation

### Exercise 01

Combine basic geometries to create a wind turbine model

### Exercise 02

Create an "Animation On" button that will start the rotation of the blades.
Add a slider to change the turbine's spin speed

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula06.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula06.js)

## Class 07 - Lighting

### Exercise 01

Create a white teapot that will be illuminated by 3 lightspots: a red one, a gren one and a blue one.
Allow lightspots to move along three horizontal bars.
Enable keys to command the movement of lightspots.
Create a teapot rotation animation.
Create buttons that turn animations and lightspots on/off.
