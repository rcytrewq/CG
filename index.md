# Computer Graphics 2021.1

On this page my work will be presented throughout the Computer Graphics course at UFJF, using the three.js library.

The basic projects that support the course can be obtained at [this link](https://rodrigoluis.github.io/CG/)

## Class 01 - Introduction to three.js

### Exercise 01 

Create three cubes of different sizes in different positions on the base plane


* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex01.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex01.js)

### Exercise 02

Create a cube, a sphere and a cylinder on the base plane

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex02.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex02.js)

### Exercise 03

Create nine cubes on the base plane using a loop

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula01_ex03.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula01_ex03.js)

## Class 02 - Geometric Transformation

### Exercise 01

Add a segment to the developed virtual arm [in this code](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/src/geometricTransformation2.js) and a slider that controls it

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula02_ex1.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula02_ex01.js)

### Exercise 02

Enable the rotation of the base of each segment on the three axes

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula02_ex02.html)

* [src](https://github.com/rcytrewq/CG/blob/main/works/aula02_ex02.js)


## Class 03 - Projections and Virtual Cameras

### Exercise 01

Develop an environment that allows the navigation through manipulation of the camera position

* [solution](https://rcytrewq.github.io/CG/works/aula03.html)
